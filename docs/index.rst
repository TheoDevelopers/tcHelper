Welcome to tcHelper's documentation!
====================================

What is tcHelper?
-----------------

tcHelper is a program to aid public talk coordinators, PTC, in the congregations
of Jehovah's Witness. It is written in Python3 and uses the Qt GUI framework
(PySide2) and SQLite3 for its database, all of which are open source and cross
platform technologies. Visit the project's wiki for more information. tcHelper
grew out of another project called pyTalkManager.

tcHelper differentiates its self from other PTC software in a number of ways.
For one, it is an open source project. Also, tcHelper will not be sold or have
features that can only be unlocked with donations. Since tcHelper is open
source and uses the GPL v.3 license, other PTC software developers can create
programs that interact with tcHelper.

Development
-----------

tcHelper is being actively developed and is still in its early stages. Check
back every few weeks to keep an eye on the progress.
